# Marvelous-Movies
As part of a Networking course at LSU, I was tasked with creating a 3-Tier Website Application hosted on an EC2 Instance. I decided on creating an IMDB-type website where users could leave reviews on the Marvel Movies in Phase 1, as well as view each movie, incluidng its cast and trailer.

Below is a video demo of the website that was created for class.
